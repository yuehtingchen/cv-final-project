abstract = {Purpose
To develop a machine learning tool capable of differentiating eyes of subjects with normal cognition from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA).
Design
Evaluation of a diagnostic technology.
Participants
Subjects with normal cognition were compared to subjects with MCI.
Methods
A multimodal convolutional neural network (CNN) was built to predict likelihood of MCI from ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thickness maps, OCTA images, and quantitative data including patient characteristics.
Main Outcome Measures
Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and summaries of the confusion matrix (sensitivity and specificity) were used as performance metrics for the prediction outputs of the CNN.
Results
Images from 236 eyes of 129 cognitively normal subjects and 154 eyes of 80 MCI subjects were used for training, validating, and testing the CNN. When applied to the independent test set using inputs including GC-IPL thickness maps, OCTA images, and quantitative OCT and OCTA data, the AUC value for the CNN was 0.809 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.681–0.937). This model achieved a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 83%. The AUC value for GC-IPL thickness maps alone was 0.681 (95% CI: 0.529–0.832), for OCTA images alone was 0.625 (95% CI: 0.466–0.784) and for both GC-IPL maps and OCTA images was 0.693 (95% CI: 0.543–0.843). Models using quantitative data alone were also tested, with a model using quantitative data derived from images, 0.960 (95% CI: 0.902–1.00), outperforming a model using demographic data alone, 0.580 (95% CI: 0.417–0.742).
Conclusions
This novel CNN was able to identify an MCI diagnosis using an independent test set comprised of OCT and OCTA images and quantitative data. The GC-IPL thickness maps provided more useful decision support than the OCTA images. The addition of quantitative data inputs also provided significant decision support to the CNN to identify individuals with MCI. Quantitative imaging metrics provided superior decision support than demographic data.

abstract = {Abstract Aims We mainly evaluate retinal alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, investigate the associations between retinal changes with AD biomarkers, and explore an optimal machine learning (ML) model for AD diagnosis based on retinal thickness. Methods A total of 159 AD patients and 299 healthy controls were enrolled. The retinal parameters of each participant were measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, cognitive impairment severity, brain atrophy, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers were measured in AD patients. Results AD patients demonstrated a significant decrease in the average, superior, and inferior quadrant peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, macular retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL) thicknesses, as well as total macular volume (TMV) (all p < 0.05). Moreover, TMV was positively associated with Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores, IPL thickness was correlated negatively with the medial temporal lobe atrophy score, and the GCL thickness was positively correlated with CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 and negatively associated with p-tau level. Based on the significantly decreased OCT variables between both groups, the XGBoost algorithm exhibited the best diagnostic performance for AD, whose four references, including accuracy, area under the curve, f1 score, and recall, ranged from 0.69 to 0.74. Moreover, the macular retinal thickness exhibited an absolute superiority for AD diagnosis compared with other enrolled variables in all ML models. Conclusion We identified the retinal alterations in AD patients and found that macular thickness and volume were associated with AD severity and biomarkers. Furthermore, we confirmed that OCT combined with ML could serve as a potential diagnostic tool for AD.},
